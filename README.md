# AI Reel Maker API

A comprehensive FastAPI application for generating AI-powered video content using advanced AI models including Gemini 2.5 Flash, Minimax image-01, Flux Kontext, and ByteDance Seedance-1-pro.

This repository also includes a Vercel-ready Next.js frontend under `web/`. The deployed frontend is a static showcase and does not generate new videos or require API tokens.

## 🚀 Features

- **Storyboard Generation**: Create 60-second video scripts with 12 scenes
- **Character Creation**: Generate character prompts and images
- **Setting Creation**: Generate setting prompts and images
- **Scene Combination**: Combine characters and settings into cohesive scenes
- **Video Generation**: Create high-quality videos from scenes
- **Static Demo Assets**: Showcase generated reels from `web/public/videos/`

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Replicate API token
- FastAPI and dependencies

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai-reel-maker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Copy the example file and add your own Replicate token:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   ```env
   REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_token_here
   AI_REEL_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

   `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` is required only when running the backend generation pipeline locally.

4. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   uvicorn api.main:app --reload
   ```

5. **Access the API**
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Alternative docs: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## ⚙️ Automated Workflow

You can run the end-to-end pipeline with a single script. It will:

- Generate the storyboard (12 scenes, 1 character throughout)
- Create the character prompt and image
- For Scene 1 only: create setting prompt + setting image, then combine with character
- For Scenes 2-12: extract a frame from the previous scene's video and reuse it as the `initial_image`
- Generate each 5-second scene video (uses the scene's description directly as the prompt)
- Merge all scene videos into a single 60-second video

Run:

```bash
python3 run_workflow.py
```

Notes:

- The script defaults to: "A woman sits at her window watching a heavy rainstorm, finding peaceful joy in the cozy warmth of her dry indoor space."
- It calls `http://localhost:8000` by default. Set `AI_REEL_API_URL` to use a different local API URL.
- It does not call `/video-prompt`; instead it passes each scene's `description` directly to `/generate-video`.

## 🎞️ Demo Videos

The frontend demo assets live under:

```text
web/public/videos/
```

Current demo paths:

- `web/public/videos/demo-1.mp4` — final mix
- `web/public/videos/demo-2.mp4` — raw cut

In a Next.js app inside `web/`, these can be referenced as `/videos/demo-1.mp4` and `/videos/demo-2.mp4`.

## 🌐 Vercel Frontend Deployment

Deploy the static Vidora frontend from the `web` directory:

- Set the Vercel root directory to `web`.
- No frontend environment variables are required.
- The frontend does not call the FastAPI backend or use API tokens.
- Keep the generated demo videos under `web/public/videos/` so they are served as `/videos/demo-1.mp4` and `/videos/demo-2.mp4`.

Only local backend generation requires `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`.

## 🎬 API Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Storyboard

```bash
POST /storyboard
{
  "idea": "A detective investigating a mysterious case in a dimly lit office"
}
```

### Step 2: Create Character

```bash
# Generate character prompt
POST /character-prompt
{
  "description": "A detective in his 40s with a weathered face",
  "name": "Detective Smith"
}

# Generate character image
POST /character-image
{
  "prompt": "Detailed character prompt from previous step"
}
```

### Step 3: For Each Scene (12 scenes total)

**Note**:

- **Scene 1**: Create setting (setting-prompt + setting-image)
- **Scenes 2-12**: Reuse the same setting from Scene 1, but extract a frame from the previous scene's video to use as the `initial_image` for the current scene's video generation

#### 3a. Create Setting (Scene 1 only)

```bash
# Generate setting prompt (only for Scene 1)
POST /setting-prompt
{
  "description": "A dimly lit office with evidence scattered on desk"
}

# Generate setting image (only for Scene 1)
POST /setting-image
{
  "prompt": "Detailed setting prompt from previous step"
}
```

#### 3b. Combine Character and Setting

```bash
# Generate combination prompt
POST /combine-prompt
{
  "scene_description": "Detective examining evidence in the office"
}

# Generate combined scene image
POST /combine-image
{
  "prompt": "Combination prompt from previous step",
  "character_image": "URL from character-image",
  "setting_image": "URL from setting-image (Scene 1) OR reuse from Scene 1 (Scenes 2-12)"
}
```

#### 3c. Extract Frame from Video (Required for scenes 2-12)

```bash
# Extract a representative frame from the previous scene's video
# This frame becomes the initial_image for the next scene's video generation
POST /extract-frame
{
  "video_url": "URL from the previous scene's generated video"
}
```

#### 3d. Generate Video

```bash
# Generate video prompt (optional)
POST /video-prompt
{
  "scene_description": "Detective examining evidence in the office"
}

# Generate final video
POST /generate-video
{
  "prompt": "Either the video prompt (above) OR the scene description directly",
  "initial_image": "URL from combine-image (for scene 1) OR extracted frame URL (for scenes 2-12)"
}
```

### Step 4: Add Sound Effects (Optional)

```bash
# Add sound effects to individual videos or the final merged video
POST /add-sound-effect
{
  "video_url": "URL from any generated video"
}
```

### Step 5: Merge All Scene Videos (After all 12 scenes are generated)

```bash
# Merge all generated scene videos into one final video
POST /merge-videos
{
  "video_urls": [
    "URL from scene 1 video",
    "URL from scene 2 video",
    "URL from scene 3 video",
    "... (all 12 scene video URLs)"
  ]
}
```
